Responsiveness is one of three components of [Materialize's Trust pillar of product value](https://materialize.com/blog/operational-attributes/#trust), the other two being [freshness](https://materialize.com/blog/freshness/) and [consistency](https://materialize.com/blog/operational-consistency/).
While being fresh and consistent is fundamental, operational work suffers if each intervention is a 15 minute deployment away.
We all want to live in world where our operational logic is fully baked, but the reality is that things change and interactivity matters.
Moreover, operational work is often inherently interactive: responding to user or operator queries that are not known ahead of time.
For these reasons, among others, systems must be responsive to be a trustworthy part of your operational layer.

Different architectures have different visions for how work gets done, which leads to different responsiveness characteristics.
The conventional cloud data warehouse pulls stale data from cloud storage and re-evaluates your query, each time from scratch and at some cost.
Dataflow engines generally re-flow the streams that define their inputs, which happens at high throughput but still takes time to cover the volume of data.
Caches and microservices generally nail responsiveness, though without much to say about consistency or freshness.
The caveats make none of these alternatives especially satisfying.

Responsiveness is about more than just promptly providing a response: the response needs to be valuable and actionable.
Systems can trivially respond with inconsistent, stale, or unhelpful results ("nothing yet, boss"), but we understand that this doesn't yet provide value.
They can promptly respond to interventions with confirmation of initiation ("just starting, boss"), but this doesn't mean any work will soon be done.
Responsiveness provides value when the response has meaning, which we believe is captured by consistency and freshness (which is why we covered them first!).
A responsive system must promptly provide a *meaningful* response; otherwise it is just entertainment.

In this post we'll dive into how Materialize makes commands responsive, from the structure it exploits in both data and queries, through the technical underpinnings, up to an example of responsive, fresh, and consistent results for non-trivial operational work involving multi-way joins.

## Responsiveness in Materialize

In Materialize, responsiveness is about minimizing the time between an issued command and Materialize's consistent, fresh responses (to the operator, or to downstream consumers).

Achieving responsiveness is about much more than just programming hard to make computers go fast. 
It is about preparing and organizing information ahead of time so that when commands arrive we have the answers (nearly) at hand.
When `SELECT` commands arrive, from easy `LIMIT 1`s to hard multi-way `JOIN`s, we want to minimize the time required before Materialize can provide the result.
When users create indexes, materialized views, and sinks, we want to minimize the time before those assets are operational.
In each case, we want to identify and exploit structure in the data and the commands to make subsequent work fast.

We also try to program rly hard, but the gains really come from the preparation instead.
