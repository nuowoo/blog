[Building live random data from just SQL](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2024-05-19.md#operational-data-from-thin-air)\r\n\r\n    Starting from nothing more than SQL, we'll create a live view that Materialize can maintain containing recent moments as timestamps.\r\n    As time continually moves forward, those moments continually change.\r\n\r\n4.  [All the SQL](https://github.com/frankmcsherry/blog/blob/master/posts/2024-05-19.md#appendix-all-the-sql) Really, just SQL.\r\n\r\nFeel more than welcome to leap to the sections that interest you most.\r\nI recommend starting at the beginning, though!\r\n\r\n### Demonstrating Materialize\r\n\r\nLet's sit down with Materialize and some live auction data and see if we can't hit the beats of responsiveness, freshness, and consistency.\r\nThe story is borrowed from our own quickstart, but by the end of it we'll find we've swapped out the quickstart's built-in load generator.\r\n\r\nMaterialize's [`AUCTION` load generator](https://materialize.com/docs/sql/create-source/load-generator/#auction) populates `auctions` and `bids` tables.\r\nTheir contents look roughly like so:\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select * from auctions;\r\n id | seller |        item        |          end_time          \r\n----+--------+--------------------+----------------------------\r\n  2 |   1592 | Custom Art         | 2024-05-20 13:43:16.398+00\r\n  3 |   1411 | City Bar Crawl     | 2024-05-20

select * from bids;\r\n id | buyer | auction_id | amount |          bid_time          \r\n----+-------+------------+--------+----------------------------\r\n 31 |    88 |          3 |     67 | 2024-05-20 13:43:10.402+00\r\n 10 |  3844 |          1 |     59 | 2024-05-20 13:42:56.387+00\r\n 11 |  1861 |          1 |     40 | 2024-05-20 13:42:57.387+00\r\n 12 |  3338 |          1 |     97 | 2024-05-20 13:42:58.387+00\r\n ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe will root around in this data, as it changes, and show off Materialize as something unlike other data tools.\r\nSpecifically we'll want to show off responsiveness, freshness, and consistency, which we'll do in that order.\r\nHowever, the point is that you get them all at the same time, rather than one at a time, and by the end we should be able to see all three at once.\r\n\r\n#### Beat 1: Responsiveness\r\n\r\nMaterialize is able to respond immediately, even to complex queries over large volumes of data.\r\nLet's start by looking at the data, counting the number of auctions and the number of bids.\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select count(*) from auctions;\r\n count \r\n-------\r\n 86400\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nTime: 52.580 ms\r\n```\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select count(*) from bids;\r\n  count   \r\n----------\r\n 10994252\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nTime: 8139.897 ms (00:08.140)\r\n```\r\nIt's almost 100k auctions, and over 10M bids across them.\r\nThe specific numbers will make more sense when we get to the generator, but some of you may already recognize 86,400.\r\nTen seconds to count ten million things is not great, but this is running on our smallest instance (`25cc`; roughly 1/4 of a core).\r\nAlso, we aren't yet using Materialize's super-power to *maintain* results.\r\n\r\nMaterialize maintains computed results in indexes, created via the `CREATE INDEX` command.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Maintain bids indexed by id.\r\nCREATE INDEX bids_id ON bids (id);\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen we want to find a specific bid by id, this can be very fast .\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select * from bids where id = 4;\r\n id | buyer | auction_id | amount |        bid_time        \r\n----+-------+------------+--------+------------------------\r\n  4 |   228 |    6492730 |    149 | 2024-06-19 13:57:50+00\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nTime: 19.711 ms\r\n```\r\nInspecting the query history (a feature in Materialize's console) we can see it only took 5ms for the DB, and the additional latency is between NYC and AWS's us-east-1.\r\nThis really is just a look-up into a maintained index, admittedly only on `bids` rather than some sophisticated query.\r\n\r\nYou can build indexes on any collection of data, not just raw data like `bids`.\r\nWe could build an index on `SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bids` to make that fast too, for example.\r\nInstead, let's go straight to the good stuff.\r\n\r\nHere's a view that determines which auctions are won by which bids.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Determine auction winners: the greatest bid before expiration.\r\nCREATE VIEW winning_bids AS\r\n  SELECT DISTINCT ON (auctions.id) bids.*,\r\n    auctions.item,\r\n    auctions.seller\r\n  FROM auctions, bids\r\n  WHERE auctions.id = bids.auction_id\r\n    AND bids.bid_time < auctions.end_time\r\n    AND mz_now() >= auctions.end_time\r\n  ORDER BY auctions.id,\r\n    bids.amount DESC,\r\n    bids.bid_time,\r\n    bids.buyer;\r\n```\r\n\r\nDirectly querying this view results in a not-especially-responsive experience\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select auction_id, buyer, amount from winning_bids limit 5;\r\n auction_id | buyer | amount \r\n------------+-------+--------\r\n        217 |    41 |    252\r\n       3328 |   209 |     55\r\n      19201 |   147 |    255\r\n      18947 |    34 |    254\r\n       7173 |   143 |      5\r\n(5 rows)\r\n\r\nTime: 87428.589 ms (01:27.429)\r\n```\r\nWe are grinding through all the bids from scratch when you select from a view, because the view only explains what query you want to run.\r\nA view by itself doesn't cause any work to be done ahead of time.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can create indexes on `winning_bids`, and once they are up and running everything gets better.\r\nWe are going to create two indexes, on the columns `buyer` and `seller`, for future storytelling reasons.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Compute and maintain winning bids, indexed two ways.\r\nCREATE INDEX wins_by_buyer ON winning_bids (buyer);\r\nCREATE INDEX wins_by_seller ON winning_bids (seller);\r\n```\r\nThe auctions aren't faster to magic in to existence than the original query was, so we'll have to wait a moment for them to hydrate.\r\nOnce this has happened, you get responsive interactions with the view.\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select auction_id, buyer, amount from winning_bids limit 5;\r\n auction_id | buyer | amount \r\n------------+-------+--------\r\n    7647534 |     0 |    254\r\n    6568079 |     0 |    239\r\n   10578840 |     0 |    254\r\n   14208479 |     0 |    249\r\n   15263465 |     0 |    199\r\n(5 rows)\r\n\r\nTime: 61.283 ms\r\n```\r\nRather than grind over the ten million or so bids to find winners, the ~80,000 results are maintained and its easy to read the first five.\r\nMoreover, the results are all immediately up to date, rather than being fast-but-stale.\r\nLet's hit that **freshness** beat now!\r\n\r\n<!-- \r\nIn addition, our indexes set us up for responsive ad-hoc queries.\r\nHere's an example where we look for 'auction flippers': folks who are both buyers and sellers of the same item at increased amounts:\r\n```sql\r\n-- Look for users who re-sell their winnings\r\nCREATE VIEW potential_flips AS\r\n  SELECT w2.seller,\r\n         w2.item AS item,\r\n         w2.amount AS seller_amount,\r\n         w1.amount AS buyer_amount\r\n  FROM winning_bids w1,\r\n       winning_bids w2\r\n  WHERE w1.buyer = w2.seller\r\n    AND w2.amount > w1.amount\r\n    AND w1.item = w2.item;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe have enough auctions that some folks will be both buyers and sellers, and for some fraction of them its the same item for an increased price.\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select count(*) from potential_flips;\r\n count \r\n-------\r\n  9755\r\n(1 row)\r\n\r\nTime: 602.481 ms\r\n```\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select seller, count(*) from potential_flips group by seller order by count(*) desc limit 5;\r\n seller | count \r\n--------+-------\r\n  42091 |     7\r\n  42518 |     6\r\n  10529 |     6\r\n  39840 |     6\r\n  49317 |     6\r\n(5 rows)\r\n\r\nTime: 678.330 ms\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is now pretty interactive, using scant resources, over enough data and through complex views that to start from scratch would be exhausting.\r\nHowever, maintained indexes keep intermediate results up to date, and you get the same results as if re-run from scratch, just without the latency. -->\r\n\r\n#### Beat 2: Freshness\r\n\r\nAll of this auction data is synthetic, and while it changes often the show is pretty clearly on rails.\r\nThat is, Materialize knows ahead of time what the changes will be.\r\nYou want to know that Materialize can respond fast to *arbitrary* changes, including ones that Materialize doesn't anticipate.\r\n\r\nWe need **interaction**!\r\n\r\nLet's create a table we can modify, through our own whims and fancies.\r\nOur modifications to this table, not part of the load generator, will be how we demonstrate the speed at which Materialize updates results as data change.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Accounts that we might flag for fraud.\r\nCREATE TABLE fraud_accounts (id bigint);\r\n```\r\n\r\nLet's look at a query that calls out the top five accounts that win auctions.\r\nWe'll subscribe to it, meaning we get to watch the updates as they happen.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Top five non-fraud accounts, by auction wins.\r\nCOPY (SUBSCRIBE TO (\r\n  SELECT buyer, count(*)\r\n  FROM winning_bids\r\n  WHERE buyer NOT IN (SELECT id FROM fraud_accounts)\r\n  GROUP BY buyer\r\n  ORDER BY count(*) DESC, buyer LIMIT 5\r\n)) TO STDOUT;\r\n```\r\nThis produces first a snapshot and then a continual stream of updates.\r\nIn our case, the updates are going to derive from our manipulation of `fraud_accounts`.\r\n```\r\n1718981380562\t1\t7247\t7\r\n1718981380562\t1\t17519\t7\r\n1718981380562\t1\t27558\t7\r\n1718981380562\t1\t20403\t7\r\n1718981380562\t1\t16584\t7\r\n```\r\nThe data are not really changing much, on account of the winners all having the same counts.\r\nBut, this is actually good for us, because we can see what happens when we force a change.\r\n\r\nAt this point, let's insert the record `17519` into `fraud_accounts`.\r\n```\r\n-- Mark 17519 as fraudulent\r\n1718981387841\t-1\t17519\t7\r\n1718981387841\t1\t32134\t7\r\n```\r\nWe can do the same with `16584`, and then `34985`.\r\n```\r\n-- Mark 16584 as fraudulent\r\n1718981392977\t1\t34985\t7\r\n1718981392977\t-1\t16584\t7\r\n-- Mark 34985 as fraudulent\r\n1718981398158\t1\t35131\t7\r\n1718981398158\t-1\t34985\t7\r\n```\r\nFinally, let's remove all records from `fraud_accounts` and we can see that we return back to the original state.\r\n```\r\n-- Remove all fraud indicators.\r\n1718981403087\t-1\t35131\t7\r\n1718981403087\t1\t17519\t7\r\n1718981403087\t-1\t32134\t7\r\n1718981403087\t1\t16584\t7\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThat `34985` record isn't mention here because it only showed up due to our other removals.\r\nWe don't hear about a change because there is no moment when it is in the top five, even transiently.\r\nThat is a great lead-in to Materailize's **consistency** properties!\r\n\r\n#### Beat 3: Consistency\r\n\r\nAll the freshness and responsiveness in the world doesn't mean much if the results are incoherent.\r\nMaterialize only ever presents actual results that actually happened, with no transient errors.\r\nWhen you see results, you can confidently act on them knowing that they are real, and don't need further second to bake.\r\n\r\nLet's take a look at consistency through the lens of account balances as auctions close and winning buyers must pay sellers.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Account ids, with credits and debits from auctions sold and won.\r\nCREATE VIEW funds_movement AS\r\n  SELECT id,\r\n         SUM(credits) AS credits,\r\n         SUM(debits) AS debits\r\n  FROM (\r\n    SELECT seller AS id, amount AS credits, 0 AS debits\r\n    FROM winning_bids\r\n    UNION ALL\r\n    SELECT buyer AS id, 0 AS credits, amount AS debits\r\n    FROM winning_bids\r\n  )\r\n  GROUP BY id;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese balances derive from the same source: `winning_bids`, and although they'll vary from account to account, they should all add up.\r\nSpecifically, if we get the total credits and the total debits, they should 100% of the time be exactly equal.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Discrepancy between credits and debits.\r\nSELECT SUM(credits) - SUM(debits) \r\nFROM funds_movement;\r\n```\r\nThis query reports zero, 100% of the time.\r\nWe can `SUBSCRIBE` to the query to be notified of any change.\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> COPY (SUBSCRIBE (\r\n    SELECT SUM(credits) - SUM(debits) \r\n    FROM funds_movement\r\n)) TO STDOUT;\r\n\r\n1716312983129\t1\t0\r\n```\r\nThis tells us that starting at time `1716312983129`, there was `1` record, and it was `0`.\r\nYou can sit there a while, and there will be no changes.\r\nYou could also add the `WITH (PROGRESS)` option, and it will provide regular heartbeats confirming that second-by-second it is still zero.\r\nThe credits and debits always add up, and aren't for a moment inconsistent.\r\n\r\nWe can set up similar views for other assertions.\r\nFor example, every account that has sold or won an auction should have a balance.\r\nA SQL query can look for violations of this, and we can monitor it to see that it is always empty.\r\nIf it is ever non-empty, perhaps there are bugs in the query logic, its contents are immediately actionable: \r\nthere is a specific time where the inputs evaluated to an invariant-violating output, and if you return to that moment you'll see the inputs that produce the bad output.\r\n\r\nThe consistency extends across multiple independent sessions.\r\nThe moment you get confirmation that the insert into `fraud_accounts`, you can be certain that no one will see that account in the top five non-fraudulent auction winners.\r\nThis guarantee is called 'strict serializability', that the system behaves as if every event occurred at a specific time between its start and end, and is the strongest guarantee that databases provide.\r\n\r\n#### Demo over!\r\n\r\nThat's it!\r\nWe've completed the introduction to Materialize, and used auction data to show off responsiveness, freshness, and consistency.\r\nThere's a lot more to show off, of course, and if any of this sounded fascinating you should swing by https://materialize.com/register/ to spin up a trial environment.\r\n\r\nHowever, in this post we will continue to unpack how we got all of that `auctions` and `bids` data in the first place!\r\n\r\n### Auction Data from Changing Moments\r\n\r\nWhere do the `auctions` and `bids` data come from?\r\nYou can get them from our load generator, but we're going to try and coax them out of raw SQL.\r\nWe're going to start with something we haven't introduced yet, but it's a view whose content looks like this\r\n```sql\r\n-- All seconds within the past 24 hours.\r\nCREATE VIEW moments AS\r\nSELECT generate_series(\r\n    now() - '1 day'::interval + '1 second'::interval,\r\n    now(),\r\n    '1 second'\r\n) moment;\r\n``` \r\n\r\nUnpacking this, `moments` contains rows with a single column containing a timestamp.\r\nWhenever we look at it, the view contains those timestamps at most one day less than `now()`.\r\nIt should have at any moment exactly 86,400 records present, as many as `auctions` up above.\r\n\r\nImportantly, this view definition will not actually work for us.\r\nYou are welcome to try it out, but you'll find out that while it can be *inspected*, it cannot be *maintained*.\r\nWe'll fix that by the end of the post, but it will need to wait until the next section.\r\nFor the moment, let's assume we have this view and the magical ability to keep it up to date.\r\n\r\nThese 'moments' are not auction data, though.\r\nHow do we get from moments to auctions and bids?\r\n\r\nThe `auctions` and `bids` collections look roughly like so:\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> select * from auctions;\r\n id | seller |        item        |          end_time          \r\n----+--------+--------------------+----------------------------\r\n  2 |

seller id, an item description, and an end time.\r\nBids have a unique id (no relation), a buyer id, an auction id, the amount of the bid, and the time of the bid.\r\n\r\nThe `seller`, `item`, `buyer`, and `amount` fields are all random, within some bounds.\r\nAs a first cut, we'll think about just using random values for each of the columns.\r\nWhere might we get randomness, you ask?\r\nWell, if *pseudo*-randomness is good enough (it will be), we can use cryptographic hashes of the moments.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Extract pseudorandom bytes from each moment.\r\nCREATE VIEW random AS\r\nSELECT moment, digest(moment::text, 'md5') as random\r\nFROM moments;\r\n```\r\nLet's start with bytes from `random` to populate columns, and we'd have a first cut at random data.\r\nColumns like `auctions.item` are populated by joining with a constant collection (part of the generator), but `id` and `seller` could just be random.\r\nThe `end_time` we'll pick to be a random time up to 256 minutes after the auction starts.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Totally accurate auction generator.\r\nCREATE VIEW auctions_core AS\r\nSELECT \r\n    moment,\r\n    random,\r\n    get_byte(random, 0) + \r\n    get_byte(random, 1) * 256 + \r\n    get_byte(random, 2) * 65536 as id,\r\n    get_byte(random, 3) +\r\n    get_byte(random, 4) * 256 as seller,\r\n    get_byte(random, 5) as item,\r\n    -- Have each auction expire after up to 256 minutes.\r\n    moment + (get_byte(random, 6)::text || ' minutes')::interval as end_time\r\nFROM random;\r\n```\r\nWe've clearly made some calls about how random each of these should be, and those calls influence what we'll see in the data.\r\nFor example, we've established at most 65,536 sellers, which lines up fine with our 86,400 auctions at any moment; some sellers will have multiple auctions and many will not.\r\nAuctions are open for a few hours on average, close out but linger, and then vanish after 24 hours.\r\nIf we want to change any of these, perhaps to add more distinct items, or keep auctions running longer, or to skew the distribution over sellers, we can!\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the columns of `bids` are also pretty random, but columns like `auction_id` and `bid_time` do need to have some relationship to `auctions` and the referenced auction.\r\nWe'll build those out in just a moment, but have a bit more tidying to do for `auctions` first.\r\n\r\n#### Adding Custom Expiration\r\n\r\nOur auctions wind down after some random amount of time, but they are not removed from `auctions` for three hours.\r\nThematically we can think of this as auctions whose winners have been locked in, but whose accounts have not yet been settled.\r\n\r\nIf we want the auction to vanish from `auctions` at this time it closed, we could accomplish this with a temporal filter:\r\n```sql\r\nWHERE mz_now() < end_time\r\n```\r\nAs soon as we reach `end_time` the auction would vanish from `auctions`.\r\n\r\nThis is a very helpful pattern for load generators that want to control when data arrive and when it departs, in finer detail than 'a twenty four hour window'.\r\nFor example, one could randomly generate `insert_ts` and `delete_ts`, and then use\r\n```sql\r\n-- Create an event that is live for the interval `[insert_ts, delete_ts]`.\r\nWHERE mz_now() BETWEEN insert_ts AND delete_ts\r\n```\r\nThis pattern allows careful control of when events *appear* to occur, by holding them back until `mz_now()` reaches a value, and then retracting them when it reaches a later value. \r\n\r\n#### Making More Realistic Data\r\n\r\nOur random numbers for `item` aren't nearly as nice as what the existing load generator produces.\r\nHowever, we can get the same results by putting those nice values in a view and using our integer `item` to join against the view.\r\n```sql\r\n-- A static view giving names to items.\r\nCREATE VIEW items (id, item) AS VALUES\r\n    (0, 'Signed Memorabilia'),\r\n    (1, 'City Bar Crawl'),\r\n    (2, 'Best Pizza in Town'),\r\n    (3, 'Gift Basket'),\r\n    (4, 'Custom Art');\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow when we want to produce an actual auction record, we can join against items like so\r\n```sql\r\n-- View that mirrors the `auctions` table from our load generator.\r\nCREATE VIEW auctions AS\r\nSELECT id, seller, items.item, end_time\r\nFROM auctions_core, items\r\nWHERE auction.item = items.id;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe've now got a view `auctions` that mirrors what Materialize's load generator produces, at least superficially.\r\n\r\n#### Introducing Foreign Key Constraints\r\n\r\nEach bid in `bids` references an auction, and we are unlikely to find an extant auction if we just use random numbers for `auction_id`.\r\nWe'd like to base our `bids` on the available auctions, and have them occur at times that make sense for the auction.\r\n\r\nWe can accomplish this by deriving the bids for an auction from `auctions` itself.\r\nWe will use some available pseudorandomness to propose a number of bids, and then create further pseudorandomness to determine the details of each bid.\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE VIEW bids AS\r\n-- Establish per-bid records and pseudorandomness.\r\nWITH prework AS (\r\n    -- Create `get_byte(random, 6)` many bids for each auction, \r\n    -- each with their own freshly generated pseudorandomness.\r\n    SELECT \r\n        id as auction_id,\r\n        moment as auction_start,\r\n        end_time as auction_end,\r\n        digest(random::text || generate_series(1, get_byte(random, 6))::text, 'md5') as random\r\n    FROM auctions_core\r\n)\r\nSELECT\r\n    get_byte(random, 0) +\r\n    get_byte(random, 1) * 256 +\r\n    get_byte(random, 2) * 65536 as id,\r\n    get_byte(random, 3) AS buyer,\r\n    auction_id,\r\n    get_byte(random, 4)::numeric AS amount,\r\n    auction_start + (get_byte(random, 5)::text || ' seconds')::interval as bid_time\r\nFROM prework;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe now have a pile of bids for each auction, with the compelling property that when the auction goes away so too do its bids.\r\nThis gives us 'referential integrity', the property of foreign keys (`bids.auction_id`) that their referent (`auction.id`) is always valid.\r\n\r\nAnd with this, we have generated the `auctions` and `bids` data that continually change, but always make sense.\r\n\r\nThere are several other changes you might want to make!\r\nFor example, random bids means that auctions stop changing as they go on, because new random bids are unlikely to beat all prior bids.\r\nYou could instead have the bids trend up with time, to keep the data interesting.\r\nBut, the changes are pretty easy to roll out, and just amount to editing the SQL that defines them.\r\n\r\nLet's pause for now on noodling on ways we could make the data even more realistic.\r\nUp next we have to unpack how we got that `moments` view in the first place.\r\nOnce we've done that, you are welcome to go back to playing around with load generator novelties and variations!\r\n\r\n### Operational Data from Thin Air\r\n\r\nOur `auctions` and `bids` data was based on a view `moments` that showed us all timestamps within the past three hours.\r\nWe saw how we could go from that to pretty much anything, through extracted pseudorandomness.\r\n\r\nWe used a view that seemed maybe too easy, that looked roughly like so:\r\n```sql\r\n-- Generate a sliding window over timestamp data.\r\n-- Arguments: <volume>, <velocity>\r\nSELECT moment,\r\nFROM generate_series(\r\n    '1970-01-01 00:00:00+00', \r\n    '2099-01-01 00:00:00+00', \r\n    <velocity>\r\n) moment\r\nWHERE now() BETWEEN moment AND moment + <volume>;\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis example uses `generate_series` to produce moments at which events will occur.\r\nThe `<velocity>` argument chooses the step size of the `generate_series` call, and locks in the cadence of updates.\r\nThe `<volume>` argument controls for how long each record lingers, and sets the steady state size.\r\nThe result is a sliding window over random data, where you get to control the volume and velocity.\r\n\r\nWe used `'1 second'` for the velocity and `'1 day'` for the volume.\r\n\r\nNow, while you can *type* the above, it won't actually run properly if you press enter.\r\nThe query describes 130 years of data, probably at something like a one second update frequency (because you wanted live data, right?).\r\nI don't even know how to determine how many records this is accurately based on all the leap-action that occurs.\r\nMoreover, you won't be able to materialize this view, because `now()` prevents materializations.\r\n\r\nTo actually get this to work, we'll have to use some clever tricks.\r\nThe coming subsections are a sequence of such tricks, and the punchline will be 'it works!', in case that saves you any time.\r\n\r\n#### Clever trick 1: using `mz_now()`\r\n\r\nOur first clever trick is to move from `now()` to `mz_now()`.\r\nThese are very similar functions, where the `now()` function gets you the contents of the system clock, and `mz_now()` gets you the transaction time of your command.\r\nThe main difference between the two is that we can materialize some queries containing `mz_now()`, unlike any query containing `now()`.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- Generate a sliding window over timestamp data.\r\nSELECT moment,\r\nFROM generate_series(\r\n    '1970-01-01 00:00:00+00', \r\n    '2099-01-01 00:00:00+00', \r\n    '1 second'\r\n) moment\r\n--    /------\\---- LOOK HERE!\r\nWHERE mz_now() BETWEEN moment AND moment + '1 day';\r\n```\r\nThis very simple change means that Materialize now has the ability to keep the query up to date.\r\nMaterialize has a feature called ['temporal filters'](https://materialize.com/docs/transform-data/patterns/temporal-filters/) that allows `mz_now()` in `WHERE` clauses, because we are able to invert the clause and see the moment (Materialize time) at which changes will occur.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the implementation strategy for keeping this view up to date still involves first producing all the data, and then filtering it (we don't have any magical insight into `generate_series` that allows us to invert its implementation).\r\nBut fortunately, we have other clever tricks available to us.\r\n\r\n#### Clever trick 2: Hierachical Generation\r\n\r\nThe problem above is that we generate all the data at once, and then filter it.\r\nWe could instead generate the years of interest, from them the days of interest, from them the hours of interest, then minutes of interest, then seconds of interest, and finally milliseconds of interest.\r\nIn a sense we are generating *intervals* rather than *moments*, and then producing moments from the intervals.\r\n\r\nLet's start by generating all the years we might be interested in.\r\nWe start with all the years we might reasonably need, and a `WHERE` clause that checks for intersection of the interval (`+ '1 year'`) and the extension by volume (`+ '1 day'`).\r\n```sql\r\n-- Each year-long interval of interest\r\nCREATE VIEW years AS\r\nSELECT * \r\nFROM generate_series(\r\n    '1970-01-01 00:00:00+00', \r\n    '2099-01-01 00:00:00+00', \r\n    '1 year') year\r\nWHERE mz_now() BETWEEN year AND year + '1 year' + '1 day';\r\n```\r\nThis view does not have all that many years in it. \r\nRoughly 130 of them.\r\nFew enough that we can filter them down, and get to work on days.\r\n\r\nAt this point, we'll repeatedly refine the intervals by subdividing into the next granularity.\r\nWe'll do this for years into days, but you'll have to use your imagination for the others.\r\nWe have all the SQL at the end, so don't worry that you'll miss out on that.\r\n```sql\r\n-- Each day-long interval of interest\r\nCREATE VIEW days AS\r\nSELECT * FROM (\r\n    SELECT generate_series(\r\n        year, \r\n        year + '1 year' - '1 day'::interval, \r\n        '1 day') as day\r\n    FROM years\r\n)\r\nWHERE mz_now() BETWEEN day AND day + '1 day';\r\n```\r\nWe'll repeat this on to a view `seconds`, and stop there.\r\n\r\nAlthough we could continue to milliseconds, experience has been that it's hard to demo things changing that quickly through SQL.\r\nLines of text flow past like the Matrix, and all you can really see is that there is change, not what the change is.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, there is a final gotcha.\r\nMaterialize is too clever by half, and if you materialize the `seconds` view, it will see that it is able to determine the entire 130 year timeline of the view, history and future, and record it for you.\r\nAt great expense.\r\nThese declarative systems are sometimes just too smart.\r\n\r\n#### Clever trick 3: An empty table\r\n\r\nWe can fix everything by introducing an empty table.\r\n\r\nThe empty table is only present to ruin Materialize's ability to be certain it already knows the right answer about the future.\r\nWe'll introduce it to each of our views in the same place, and its only function is to menace Materialize with the possibility that it *could* contain data.\r\nBut it won't.\r\nBut we wont tell Materialize that.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\n-- Each day-long interval of interest\r\nCREATE VIEW days AS\r\nSELECT * FROM (\r\n    SELECT generate_series(\r\n        year, \r\n        year + '1 year' - '1 day'::interval, \r\n        '1 day') as day\r\n    FROM years\r\n    -- THIS NEXT LINE IS NEW!!\r\n    UNION ALL SELECT * FROM empty\r\n)\r\nWHERE mz_now() BETWEEN day AND day + '1 day';\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith these tricks in hand, we now have the ability to spin it up and see what it looks like.\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE DEFAULT INDEX ON days;\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe'll want to create the same default indexes on our other views: `hours`, `minutes`, and `seconds`.\r\nImportantly, we want to create them in this order, also, to make sure that each relies on the one before it.\r\nIf they did not, we would be back in the world of the previous section, where each would read ahead until the end of time (the year 2099, in this example).\r\n\r\n#### Finishing touches\r\n\r\nAs a final bit of housekeeping, we'll want to go from intervals back to moments, with some additional inequalities.\r\n```sql\r\n-- The final view we'll want to use.\r\nCREATE VIEW moments AS\r\nSELECT second AS moment FROM seconds\r\nWHERE mz_now() >= second\r\n  AND mz_now() < second + '1 day';\r\n```\r\nThe only change here is the `mz_now()` inequality, which now avoids `BETWEEN` because it has inclusive upper bounds.\r\nThe result is now a view that always has exactly 24 * 60 * 60 = 86400 elements in it.\r\nWe can verify this by subscribing to the changelog of the count query:\r\n```sql\r\n-- Determine the count and monitor its changes.\r\nCOPY (\r\n    SUBSCRIBE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM moments) \r\n    WITH (progress = true)\r\n)\r\nTO stdout;\r\n```\r\nThis reports an initial value of 86400, and then repeatedly reports (second by second) that there are no additional changes.\r\n```\r\nmaterialize=> COPY (\r\n    SUBSCRIBE (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM moments) \r\n    WITH (progress = true)\r\n)\r\nTO stdout;\r\n1716210913609\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210913609\tf\t1\t86400\r\n1716210914250\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210914264\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210914685\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210915000\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210915684\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210916000\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210916248\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210916288\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210916330\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n1716210916683\tt\t\\N\t\\N\r\n^CCancel request sent\r\nERROR:  canceling statement due to user request\r\nmaterialize=> \r\n```\r\nAll rows with a second column of `t` are 'progress' statements rather than data updates.\r\nThe second row, the only one with a `f`, confirms a single record (`1`) with a value of `86400`.\r\n\r\nYeah, that's it! The only thing left is to read a wall of text containing all the SQL.\r\nActually, I recommend bouncing up to the start of the post again, and confirming that the pieces fit together for you.\r\nIt's also a fine time to [try out Materialize](https://materialize.com/register/), the only system that can run all of these views. \r\n\r\n### Appendix: All the SQL\r\n\r\n```sql\r\nCREATE TABLE empty (e TIMESTAMP);\r\n\r\n-- Supporting view to translate ids into text.\r\nCREATE VIEW items (id, item) AS VALUES\r\n    (0, 'Signed Memorabilia'),\r\n    (1, 'City Bar Crawl'),\r\n    (2, 'Best Pizza in Town'),\r\n    (3, 'Gift Basket'),\r\n    (4, 'Custom Art');\r\n\r\n-- Each year-long interval of interest\r\nCREATE VIEW years AS\r\nSELECT * \r\nFROM generate_series(\r\n    '1970-01-01 00:00:00+00', \r\n    '2099-01-01 00:00:00+00', \r\n    '1 year') year\r\nWHERE mz_now() BETWEEN year AND year + '1 year' + '1 day';\r\n\r\n-- Each day-long interval of interest\r\nCREATE VIEW days AS\r\nSELECT * FROM (\r\n    SELECT generate_series(year, year + '1 year' -
